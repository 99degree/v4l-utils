Requirements:
-------------
* make and a C and C++ compiler
* optionally libjpeg v6 or later
* optionally Qt4 for building qv4l2

Building:
---------

If you checked out the source repository you need to install the autotools
environment first. Then type "autoreconf -vfi" to generate the configure
script.

Then execute "configure" with any desired options. You can get a summary via
the --help option.
After configuration simply type "make" to start the build process.

Installing:
-----------

To install do "make install". The configured paths will be used.

Note that v4l-utils' "make install" supports DESTDIR for installing into
a build root for example:
make install DESTDIR=/mnt/sysimage
