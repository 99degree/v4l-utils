libv4l todo:
------------

-don't automatically enable the software effects (awb, gamma) on cameras
 which need flipping, most of these only produce yuv data and software
 effects are very expensive on yuv data

-move pixart rotate 90 hack to v4lconvert_decode_jpeg_tinyjpeg, since it
 is only needed on select pixart cameras, which use this function for
 decoding, this will nicely cleanup the main conversion routine

-libv4lconvert: v4lconvert_do_try_format should always prefer smaller then
 requested resolutions over bigger then requested ones

-add support for setting / getting the number of read buffers

-add code to v4l2_read to not return frames more then say 5 seconds old

-take the possibility of pitch != width into account everywhere

-make updating of parameters happen based on time elapsed rather then
 frames

-get standardized CID for AUTOGAIN_TARGET upstream and switch to that

Nice to have:

-support packed yuv as output format so that we aren't forced to do
 conversion on upside down uvc cams

-add a software rotation control (0 / 90 / 180 / 270 degrees) for tablets.
