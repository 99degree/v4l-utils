.SH NAME
cec-follower - An application to emulate cec followers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cec-follower
[\fI-h\fR] [\fI-d <dev>\fR] [other options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The cec-follower tool is used to emulate cec followers. Based on the configured
logical address(es) of the CEC device it will emulate the CEC behavior accordingly.

It is basically a message loop, waiting for messages to arrive and taking the
appropriate action for each message.

This makes it possible to act as a specific CEC device. It is also a reference
implementation on how a follower should behave.
