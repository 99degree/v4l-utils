 A typical usecase for the above API is:

void start_alsa(char *video_dev) {
	void *md;
	char *alsa_playback, *alsa_capture, *p;

	md = discover_media_devices();
	if (!md)
		return;
	alsa_capture = get_first_alsa_cap_device(md, video_dev);
	alsa_playback = get_first_no_video_out_device(md);
	if (alsa_capture && alsa_playback)
		alsa_handler(alsa_playback, alsa_capture);
	free_media_devices(md);
}

start_alsa("/dev/video0");

Where alsa_handler() is some function that will need to handle
 both alsa capture and playback devices.
